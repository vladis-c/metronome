# Take-home assignment: Metronome

Thanks for taking the time to do this! The goal of this assignment is to evaluate how you build a small, polished product feature in React Native using Expo.

## Summary

Build a metronome app. It should allow the user to set a tempo, start/stop the click, and get clear visual feedback. Bonus points for a native-looking UI and smooth animations.

## Time expectations

Aim for something you can complete in **2–4 hours**. If you go beyond that because you’re having fun, that’s totally fine — just tell us what you chose to invest extra time into.

## Requirements

1. The user should be able to adjust the tempo (BPM) and start/stop the metronome.
2. The metronome must produce a steady **audible click** at the selected **BPM**.
3. Display a **beat indicator** (e.g., pulsing circle, bouncing bar, flashing dot).
4. Use **Expo** (managed workflow preferred).
5. App should run on iOS and Android (at least in simulator/emulator).

## Deliverables

Please provide:

1. A **Git repository** (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket link) OR a zip archive
2. It should include short **README** including:
   - How to install and run the project
   - Any design/technical decisions you made
   - Known limitations / tradeoffs
   - What you’d improve with more time

## Evaluation criteria

We’ll be looking at:

- **Code quality:** readability, structure, maintainability
- **User experience:** clarity, responsiveness, and overall feel
- **Product thinking:** sensible defaults, edge cases, tradeoffs
- **Craft:** animations/polish (bonus)

## Suggested edge cases to consider (optional)

- Time signatures
- Changing BPM while the metronome is running
- Very low vs very high BPM

## Questions

If anything is unclear, make a reasonable assumption and note it in your README. We care more about how you think than perfect specs.

Good luck! Can’t wait to see what you build!
